    <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>
            1. For each HIT, you will see <b>one short passage</b> and <b>four</b> word sets. 
            <br></br>
            2. Three of the word sets will be related to the passage, but <b>the other one will be out of place</b>.
            <br></br>
            3. Your job is to pick up the one word set that seems <b>LEAST</b> related to the passage.</p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The passages and words you see are taken from U.S. senators' official Facebook postings. These postings can be on any issue or topic. Some postings are about certain legislation, some are about federal or statewide events, and some are about the administration, etc. </p>
    <h2>Attention</h2>
            <p>Some of these choices will be very clear, but others will require you to use your best judgment. It is critical that you read each passage and word grouping carefully. Scanning or reading quickly will result in low-quality evaluations, and you may be blocked from continued participation in this study (and future studies).</p>

      <b>Answer: The correct answer is "sanders, tax, budget, new, bernie, said, debt, pay". The passage is about Bryan Sperry. It is a local interest story that focuses on the achievements of a veteran a football alumni involved in a flag football game.
      <br></br>
      The word set "veterans, service, national, honor, military, thank, proud, women" clearly relates to his identity as "an 89-year-old WWII Veteran.
      <br></br>
      The word set "great, students, school, office, visit, thanks, state, county" relates to his identity as  an alumnus of the University of Kansas Football Team and the fact that this post is celebrating a local event/achievement.
      <br></br>
      The passage also references local news coverage (the post is actually about a news story), which is somewhat related to the set "watch, senate, morning, last, discuss, live, read, news."
      <br></br>
      The word set "sanders, tax, budget, new, bernie, said, debt, pay", however, seems to relate public policy and are not related to a local non-politcial event.</b>

      <b>Answer: The correct answer is "energy, water, climate, change, oil, federal, clean, regulations". The passage is in support of a state referendum on gay marriage. It also references a town hall (a local political meeting) held at a church.
      <br></br>
      Two word sets "great, students, school, office, visit, thanks, state, county" and "watch, senate, morning, last, discuss, live, read, news" relates to the fact that the post references the Senator appearing at a local political gathering.
      <br></br>
      Another word set "day, family, people, one, life, every, years, world" seems to be related to the fact that the issue concerns "marriage" and "families."
      <br></br>
      The final word set "energy, water, climate, change, oil, federal, clean, regulations", however, seems to primarily be about environmental policy.</b>

      <b>Answer: The correct answer is "president, congress, people, senate, american, americans, government, obama". The passage expresses pride in the cars and airplanes made in South Carolina.  The passage mentions cars, the police, and Boeing airplanes manufactured in South Carolina, and an airshow in London.
      <br></br>
      One word set "new, jobs, state, help, businesses, work, business, economy" clearly relates to the economy, and is related to the cars and planes manufactured in South Carolina.
      <br></br>
      A second word set "great, students, school, office, visit, thanks, state, county" again relates to the local nature and focus of the post.
      <br></br>
      A third word set "veterans, service, national, honor, military, thank, proud, women" is a bit more difficult.  Probably it is related to both the reference to the police and the international airshow.
      <br></br>
      The fourth set of words "president, congress, people, senate, american, americans, government, obama", has no real connection with the passage.</b>

        Today's <font color="red">executive order</font> from <font color="red">President Trump</font> is more about extreme <font color="red">xenophobia</font> than extreme vetting. This <font color="red">executive order</font> is the equivalent of a "Keep Out" sign posted at <font color="red">America</font>'s borders.
        <br></br>
        Turning away <font color="red">immigrants</font> based on their <font color="red">nationality and religion</font> is <font color="red">un-American</font> and in direct opposition to everything for which our Founding Fathers fought.  <font color="red">President Trump</font> may not call it a Muslim ban, but it is, and runs afoul of our morals and values.
        <br></br>
        We must ensure that we have the strongest safeguards in place to keep terrorists from ever reaching our shores. And we must fully and thoroughly vet all <font color="red">refugees</font> to screen out any potential terrorist threats.
        <br></br>
        But as conflict and war force millions around the <font color="red">world</font> from their homeland, the <font color="red">United States</font> should welcome more refugees, not less.  Suspending the <font color="red">U.S.</font> refugee resettlement program will endanger refugees' lives and tear <font color="red">families</font> apart.

      <b>Answer: The correct answer is "great, students, school, office, visit, thanks, state, county". The passage is about President Trump's executive order on immigrants, which is a national-level policy discussion.
      <br></br>
      The word set "president, congress, people, senate, american, americans, government, obama" is about national politics and, therefore, relevant.
      <br></br>
      Another word set "committee, security, hearing, secretary, united, states, department, senate" seems to relate to politics and perhaps national security.
      <br></br>
      The word set "day, family, people, one, life, every, years, world" is a bit tricky.  However, it seems to relate to social issues and is triggered by the mention of families.
      <br></br>
      The final word set "great, students, school, office, visit, thanks, state, county" seems to refer to local politics and local events and is not clearly related to the discussion of national immigration policy.</b>

      <b>Answer: The correct answer is "energy, water, climate, change, oil, federal, clean, regulations". The passage advocates for a pro-choice position and frames abortion as personal health care choices (family planning). 
      <br></br>
      The word set "health, bill, act, care, legislation, help, need, bipartisan" is about health care and, therefore, relevant.
      <br></br>
      Another word set "day, family, people, one, life, every, years, world" seems to relate to social issues and is triggered by the mention of families.
      <br></br>
      The word set "President, congress, people, senate, american, americans, government, obama" is a bit more ambiguous. It relates to legislative politics and the passage is talking about an important issue in legislative politics. Thus, it is also relevant.
      <br></br>
      The final word set "energy, water, climate, change, oil, federal, clean, regulations" is about environmental issues and not relevant to the passage.</b>

        Being conservative means controlling spending and costs. Those without insurance are forced to seek care in expensive ER's after their conditions have worsened. Hospitals are legally required to treat patients in ERs regardless of whether they can pay and they pass the cost of treatment onto the privately insured, increasing total costs. Increasing coverage and allowing more people to manage their health care is cheaper for society. The Cassidy-Collins would accomplish this.

        Today Sen. Judd Gregg and I introduced The Bipartisan Tax Fairness and Simplification Act of 2010, which will help middle-class taxpayers by streamlining and modernizing the outdated tax code. The proposal includes fiscally responsible tax cuts to help working families struggling to make ends meet and also eliminates the corporate tax break that encourages companies to invest overseas rather than creating jobs in the U.S.

        Look, here is the bottom line. We remain the only nation in the industrialized world that doesn't guarantee health care to all people. We have 29 million people who are uninsured, yet we are spending far, far more per capita on health care than do the people of any other country.

        Like so many Rhode Islanders, I am deeply disturbed by President-elect Trump's appointment of Steve Bannon to be his chief strategist in the White House. As Executive Chairman of Breitbart, Bannon served as a conduit for some of the worst sentiments in our society -- hatred and violence on the basis of race, religion, gender, and way of life. As CEO of Trump's campaign, he employed the hateful code of the white supremacist movement to leverage prejudice and fear, for political gain.  Now, the President-elect wants Bannon to help guide his administration. Many Rhode Islanders have called and written to tell me how unsettling Bannon's presence in the White House is, and I share their concern. If President-elect Trump will not denounce the dangerous ideas Steve Bannon has represented, it is up to the rest of us to stand firm against them.

        I wish Democrats would show some interest in how and why President Obama and Susan Rice got it so wrong about the true nature of the Benghazi attack.  I wish Democrats would show a little interest about why Secretary Clinton was clueless about the multiple security requests coming from Benghazi and how she allowed our mission to become a death trap.  I wish Democrats would show a little interest in finding out whether Mike Morell, the former #2 at the CIA, lied to Congress and the American people about a protest that never happened.  Democrats seem to be more interested in protecting the Obama Administration than they are in getting the truth.
        <br></br>
        If Republicans win a Senate majority in 2014, one of the first things I will insist on is hearings that actually get to the bottom of what happened before, during, and after the Benghazi attack.

        Today Chairman Johnson held a hearing on duplication, waste, and fraud in federal programs.
        <br></br>
        Seven years later, with less than half of GAO's recommendations even implemented, GAO estimates that this report has resulted in actual savings of $75 billion. One simple idea has saved American taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. However, there are still hundreds of recommendations that have gone unimplemented, and very little actual duplication in the federal government has been addressed. I am pleased that the Trump administration is taking this problem seriously. The Executive Order signed by President Trump and the memorandum by OMB Director Mulvaney that followed will result in a plan to reorganize and streamline the federal government and help it better serve the American people. This is long overdue.
